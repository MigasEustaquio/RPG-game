implement:{

    allies (started)

    add worlds (story and mechanics)

    unlock areas (for now only by magic) (require more worlds and rooms)

    abilities (almost done)

    place the sort function after acquire items, abilities, etc (player.abilities.append)


improve:{

    world map (almost done)

    enemy commands (started)


complete with data:{

    add enemies (hp, damage, commands...)

    add arenas and arena rewards (half done)

    enemy drops (half done)

    active abilities and magics balance (easier when game is complete)

}

style:{
    
    make treasure items display

    sort items, magics...

}

uncertain to do:{

    synthesize?

    save using csv? (save dict may be hard)

}
